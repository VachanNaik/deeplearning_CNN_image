# Deeplearning_CNN_image
Image classification: The goal is to build a deep learning model(Convolution neural network) model which classify the large number of images. Basically, it is end-to-end model with deployment to AWS/Heroku platform integrated to the web application.

Technology: 
•	Programming language and IDE: Python, PyCharm
•	Feature engineering using python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras etc.
•	Deep Learning algorithm(CNN(Convolution algorithm), ANN)
•	Flask as web application, AWS/ Heroku as a cloud deployment platform.
